# Array Analysis and Transformation in C++

This C++ program demonstrates basic array manipulation, including value comparison and transformation.  
It performs two main operations:

1. **Find Difference Between Max and Min Values**  
   The program calculates the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in a given integer array.

2. **Convert Positive Numbers to Negative**  
   All positive numbers in the array are transformed into their negative counterparts.

The program reads the array size and elements from user input, applies both operations, and then outputs the results.

This project serves as a simple example for beginners learning about:
- Array handling in C++
- Loops and conditional statements
- Passing arrays to functions
